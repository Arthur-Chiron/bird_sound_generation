# bird_sound_generation
Multiple architectures for generating bird sounds using BirdCLEF 2023 dataset

## Usage
+ Create the environnement
  ```bash
  conda env create -f env.yml
  ```

+ Download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2023/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2023/data) and put the train_audio folder in the working dir

+ Train models by running the VAE, GAN and VAE-GAN notebooks, you can use tensorboard to watch progress, replace ```[dir]``` with ```./vae```, ```./gan``` or ```./vaegan``` to get logs for a specific category of models, or simply ```./``` for everything (assuming you are in the bird_soud_generation folder)
  ```bash
  tensorboard --logdir=[dir]
  ```

+ Run inference for each model to generate sound files

+ Compute the Fr√©chet Audio Distance between the sounds generated by each model, and the sounds in the validation set using the FAD notebook
